      <h2>Test Results</h2>
      <p>Consistent with common medical practice, ability levels are described statistically. It is important to be
        aware that mild deficits from a statistical standpoint may interfere significantly with daily functioning.
        Percentiles are used to describe how many people out of 100 this individual would score above. For example, at
        the 50th percentile (exactly Average), {{di-name}} would score higher than 50 out of 100 people.</p>
      <p>The following table is presented below to further describe the statistical classifications, unless otherwise
        specified (e.g., BASC-3, BRIEF-2, Vineland-3). </p>
      <p>Please refer to the table below for the numerical results of John’ performance on all of the measures, as well
        as his classification level.</p>
      <p>Note for interpretation of test results: these test results are to be interpreted only within the context of
        this report. They are not to be interpreted independent of this report.</p>

        <p>The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) is a questionnaire for parents and teachers of school-age children that enables professionals to assess executive function behaviors (i.e., a collection of processes that are responsible for guiding, directing, and managing cognitive, emotional, and behavioral functions, particularly during active, novel problem solving) in the home and school environments. It is designed for a broad range of children, ages 5 to 18 years, including those with learning disabilities and attentional disorders, traumatic brain injuries, lead exposure, pervasive developmental disorders, depression and other developmental, neurological, psychiatric, and medical conditions. The Parent and Teacher Forms of the BRIEF each contain 86 items within eight theoretically and empirically derived clinical scales that measure different aspects of executive functioning. These scales form two broader Indexes, Behavioral Regulation and Metacognition, as well as an overall score, the Global Executive Composite.</p>

            <div>
                <p>This scale measures the child’s ability to manage current and future-oriented task demands. The plan component of this scale relates to the ability to anticipate future events, set goals, and develop appropriate steps ahead of time to carry out a task or activity. Planning involves imagining or developing a goal or end state and then strategically determining the most effective method or steps to attain that goal. It often requires sequencing or stringing together a series of steps.</p> 
                <p>The organizing component of this scale relates to the ability to bring order to information and to appreciate main ideas or key concepts when learning or communicating information. This involves the ability to organize oral and written expression, as well as to understand main points expressed in presentations and written material. Organization also has a clerical component that is expressed, for example, in the ability to efficiently scan a visual array or to keep track of a homework assignment.</p>

        <p>D-KEFS is a comprehensive assessment of higher-level cognitive functions—such as attention, language, and perception—in both children and adults (ages 8:0-89:0 years). The D-KEFS consists of nine tests that measure a wide spectrum of verbal and nonverbal executive functions. Each test is designed to be a standalone instrument that can be administered individually or along with other D-KEFS tests. The selection of tests to be administered depends on the assessment needs of the specific examinee or the time constraints on the examiner.</p>

              This test consists of five conditions. The primary executive-function task is the Number-Letter Switching condition, a visual-motor sequencing procedure, which is a measure of flexibility of thinking. The other four conditions allow the examiner to evaluate several key component processes needed to perform the switching task. These fundamental components include visual scanning, number sequencing, letter sequencing, and motor speed in drawing lines.

              This test measures the examinee’s ability to inhibit a more automatic verbal response (reading) in order to generate a conflicting response of naming a dissonant ink color. Another condition requires the examinee to switch back and forth between naming the dissonant ink colors and reading the conflicting words. This condition is a measure of both inhibition and cognitive flexibility.

              This tests consists of two conditions:
              <ul>
                <li>Free Sorting: the examinee is presented six mixed-up cards that display both perceptual features and printed words. The examinee is asked to sort the cards into two groups, with three cards per group, according to as many different concepts or rules as possible, and to describe the concepts employed to generate each sort. Each of the two card sets has a maximum of eight target sorts: three sorts based on verbal-semantic information from the printed words and five based on visual-spatial features or patterns on the cards. This provides a window into their ability to initiate problem-solving behavior.</li>
                <li>Sort Recognition: the examiner sorts the same sets of cards into two groups, with three cards per group, according to eight target sorts. After each sort is made by the examiner, the examinee attempts to identify and describe the correct rules or concepts used to generate the sort. This provides a window into their conceptual-reasoning skills.</li>

            <div>{{ 211-twenty-questions-test-score }}</div>
            <div>
              On this test, the examinee is presented with a stimulus page depicting pictures of 30 common objects. The examinee tried to ask the fewest number of yes/no questions in order to identify the unknown target object. Executive functions tapped by this test include the individual’s ability to identify the various categories and subcategories represented in the 30 objects and to formulate abstract, yes/no questions that eliminate the maximum number of objects regardless of the examiner’s answer.

            <div>
              The examinee’s main task in this test is to discover the meaning of made-up or mystery words based on clues given in sentences. For each mystery word, the examinee is shown five sentences (clues) that help him or her to decode the meaning of the word. With each new clue-sentence for the word, previously presented sentences are also displayed. The first sentence for each word provides only vague or general clues about the mystery word’s meaning. Each subsequent clue sentence provides progressively more detailed information. The examinee tries to decode the mystery word with as few clue sentences as possible and is asked to continue reporting the correct response to the remaining clue sentences of each item. This test is a means of evaluating executive functions in the verbal modality and assessing skills such as deductive reasoning, integration of multiple bits of information, hypothesis testing, and flexibility of thinking.

            <div>
              The materials for this test include five disks that vary is size from small to large and a board with three vertical pegs. Each item begins by the examiner’s placing from two to five disks on the pegs in a predetermined starting position and displaying a picture of the tower to be built (i.e., the ending position). The examinee’s task is to move the disks across the three pegs to build the target tower in the fewest number of moves possible. In constructing the target towers, the examinee must follow two rules: (a) to move only one disk at a time and (b) never to place a larger disk over a smaller disk. Process measures include first-move completion time, total number of moves, item-completion time, final achievement (correct or incorrect tower), and number of rule violations. This test measures spatial planning, rule learning, inhibition of impulsive responding, inhibition of perseverative responding, and establishing and maintaining the instructional set.

              In this test, proverbs are used as a means of assessing the nature of an individual’s verbal abstraction skills. The test consists of eight sayings that are presented in two conditions:
              <ul>
                <li>Free Inquiry and Multiple Choice.</li> 
                <li>For the Free Inquiry condition, the proverbs are read individually to examinees, who attempt to interpret them orally without assistance or cues.</li>
                <li>For the Multiple Choice condition, the same eight proverbs are presented individually along with four alternative interpretations from which the examinee must select the best one.</li>
                <li>The set of multiple-choice response alternatives for each proverb consists of (a) a correct abstract interpretation; (b) a correct concrete interpretation; (c) an incorrect, phonemically similar response, and (d) an unrelated saying. This task is designed for adolescents and adults aged 16-89.</li>

Verbal fluency is broadly defined in this context as language development equivalent to (or higher than) the expressive language skills of a typical 4-year-old child: producing a range of flexible sentence types and grammatical forms, using language to provide information about events out of the immediate context, and producing some logical connections within sentences (e.g., using but or though), although the individual may make some grammatical errors. Module 3 is best suited for verbally fluent children and adolescents for whom playing with action figure-type toys is age appropriate (usually under 16 years of age).</p>

        <h4 class="h3--sib-h4">CTONI-2</h4>
        <p>CTONI-2 is a norm-referenced assessment that uses nonverbal formats to measure general intelligence of children and adults (6-89 years) whose performance on traditional tests might be adversely affected by subtle or overt impairments involving language or motor abilities.</p>
        <p>The CTONI-2 measures analogical reasoning, categorical classification, and sequential reasoning, using six subtests in two different contexts: Pictures of familiar objects (e.g., people, toys, animals) and geometric designs (unfamiliar sketches and drawings).</p>
        <p>The CTONI-2 has two principal uses. The first use is to estimate the intelligence of people for whom traditional ability tests might be inappropriate. For such persons, the heavy language content or the complicated motor response demands of most mental ability tests can result in a serious underestimation of the intelligence. This often leads to misidentifications, faulty diagnoses, erroneous placements, low expectations, and other undesirable consequences. Use of the CTONI-2 will avoid many of the hazards that are frequently encountered when testing people who have a variety of disabilities (e.g., traumatic brain injury, post-stroke syndrome, deafness, aphasia, autism, or other language disorders) or come from cultural, linguistic, educational, or socioeconomic backgrounds that might negatively influence their performance on ability tests. The CTONI-2’s second use is to provide researchers with a tool that they can use to study the nature of intelligence, the interaction of verbal and nonverbal abilities, and the role of nonverbal formats in assessing thinking and academic subject matters.</p>

          DAS-II is a comprehensive and flexible instrument for assessing the cognitive abilities that are important to the learning processes of children and adolescents from ages 2 years 6 months through 17 years 11 months (2:6-17:11).
        </p>
        <p>
          The core subtests yield a composite score that is focused on reasoning and conceptual abilities, called the General Conceptual Ability (GCA) score. A set of optional diagnostic subtests provide additional information on specific abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to contributing to the GCA, the core subtests produce two or three lower-level composite or cluster scores. For children ages 2:6-3:5, the core subtests yield cluster scores measuring Verbal Ability and Nonverbal Ability. For children ages 3:6-17:11, the core subtests yield three cluster scores measuring Verbal Ability, Nonverbal Reasoning Ability, and Spatial Ability.

                Provides a measure of memory of visual material that is minimally meaningful. Five cards, each with an array of geometric shapes, are exposed and then after a brief delay the client is asked to draw what is remembered. Copying rote information from a chalkboard or remembering the shapes and locations of newly learned countries on a map are examples of everyday tasks tapping this type of visual memory. For this task, performance also is affected by attention, efficient scanning strategies, spatial skills, and executive skills.

                Measures how well an individual retains information that is manipulated while it is in the short-term memory buffer. On this subtest, the client listens to a list of nouns that are both animals and nonanimals and, immediately thereafter, must recall the words in a specified reorganized order. Two levels of difficulty are utilized. An individual performing well on this subtest also should perform well on tasks making heavy demands on verbal working memory, such as comprehending meanings in an extended reading passage, or listening to a radio sports broadcast and being able to figure out who won last night’s games as pairs of team nicknames are announced followed by their final scores.

                Measures how well a person actively operates on and retains symbolic information (e.g., numbers, letters) prior to recall. On this subtest, the client first listens to a random list of numbers and then to a random list of numbers and letters. After each section, numbers are recalled in appropriate numerical order and then numbers and letters are recalled in numerical and alphabetical order. Although memory and attention are important for this task, executive skills also are important in finding an appropriate learning strategy. Rote sequential memory may be needed for solving some math problems or in learning irregularly spelled words.

            Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory, 4th Edition (MCMI–IV) was designed to help determine personality style. The MCMI–IV is normed on a clinical population and is based on a biosocial-learning theory and evolutionary model in which personality formation is viewed as a process of learned strategies used to secure reinforcement and minimize punishment. More specifically, Millon’s personality theory considers behavioral response preferences in pleasure/pain, active/passive, and self/other domains. The test also contains measures that gauge response style and test-taking attitude which can be used determine overall validity and provide adjustments to the profile when applicable.

            TSCC (Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children) is a self-report measure of posttraumatic distress and related psychological symptomatology. It is intended for use in the evaluation of children who have experienced traumatic events, including childhood physical and sexual abuse, victimization by peers (e.g., physical or sexual assault), major losses, the witnessing of violence done to others, and natural disasters.

         <h5>Validity Scale</h5>
         <p>
            TSCC has two validity scales: one that taps a child’s tendency to deny any symptomatology and one that indexes a tendency to overrespond to symptom items.
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
              Underresponse (UND) &#10142; The UND scale reflects the extent to which the respondent denied behaviors, thoughts, or feelings that most others would report at some nonzero level.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hyperresponse (HYP) &#10142; Is when the child indiscriminately endorses the highest frequency point for many or all symptom items.

         <h5>Clinical Scale</h5>
         <p>
            The clinical scales of the TSCC measure the extent to which the child endorses six different types of potentially trauma-related symptoms. Five of the six scales (all but PTS) are nonoverlapping at the item level. Two of these clinical scales (DIS and SC) also contain scorable subscales, based upon principle components analyses and scale content.
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
                Anxiety (ANX) &#10142; Scores on the Anxiety (ANX) scale reflect the extent to which the child is experiencing generalized anxiety, hyperarousal, and worry, as well as specific fears of men or women, of the dark, and of being killed. Also tapped by this scale are episodes of free-floating anxiety and fears of impending danger.
            </li>
            <li>
                Depression (DEP) &#10142; The Depression (DEP) scale taps feelings of sadness, unhappiness, and loneliness; episodes of tearfulness; and depressive cognitions such as guilt and self-denigration.
            </li>
            <li>
                Anger (ANG) &#10142; Scores on the Anger (ANG) scale indicate the extent of angry thoughts, feelings, and behaviors reported by the child.
            </li>
            <li>
                Posttraumatic Stress &#10142; The Posttraumatic Stress (PTS) scale consists of items reflecting classic posttraumatic symptoms.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dissociation (DIS) &#10142; The Dissociation (DIS) scale measures the extent to which the child experiences mild-to-moderate dissociative symptomatology.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sexual Concerns (SC) &#10142; The Sexual Concerns (SC) scale measures sexual distress and preoccupation.
